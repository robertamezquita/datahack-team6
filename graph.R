# Calculate degree for all nodes. Degree of a node tells us the number of edges incident to the node 

# Calculate betweenness for all nodes. Betweenness centrality tells us how central 
# the node is, in terms of the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all others 
# that pass through that node

# Calculate Dice similarities between all pairs of nodes
# Dice similarity represents the similarity between two nodesâ€™ first neighborhoods
# D(node1, node2) = 2 * number of mutual neighbours of  node1 and node2 / 
# (number of neighbours of node1 + number of neighbours of node2)
